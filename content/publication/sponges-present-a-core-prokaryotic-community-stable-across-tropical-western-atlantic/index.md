  Sponges are among the earliest lineages of metazoans, with first fossil
  records dated back to 890 million years ago. All sponge species present
  associations with microorganisms to some extension, which influence sponges'
  survival and adaptation. Sponge species can be divided into two categories,
  Low Microbial Abundance and High Microbial Abundance, depending on the
  abundance of the microbial community that they host. Monanchora arbuscula (a
  Low Microbial Abundance sponge species) and Xestospongia muta (a High
  Microbial Abundance sponge species) are sponges with widespread distribution
  in the Tropical Western Atlantic. Despite previous studies on the major
  features of these species, little is known whether M. arcuscula and X. muta
  prokaryotic communities are stable across vast geographic regions. We obtained
  a total of ~9.26 million 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequences for M. arbuscula
  samples collected at seven locations and for X. muta samples collected at
  three locations, corresponding to five ecoregions of the Caribbean and the
  Southwestern Atlantic (N = 105, 39 from M. arcuscula and 66 from X. muta).
  These samples reflected different ecological strategies for prokaryotic
  communities assembly, since the core prokaryotic communities of M. arbuscula
  are more heterotrophic and shared with different sources (corals, sponges,
  seawater, sediments), while X. muta has more significant photosynthetic
  prokaryotic communities, mainly outsourced from other sponges. Results of M.
  arbuscula and X. muta prokaryotic communities analysis demonstrate that both
  sponge species have core prokaryotic communities stable across a vast
  geographic area (> 8000 km), and the world's most notable coastal marine
  biogeographic filter, the Amazon River Mouth, in spite of the significant
  differences found among transient prokaryotic communities of both sponge
  species.
