  Costa do Descobrimento is located in southern Bahia, Brazil, and only 22
  species of sponges (Porifera) were known from the area until now, despite its
  important reef formations. In the present study, we report a checklist of the
  sponges of Costa do Descobrimento and their distribution in the studied reefs,
  with several species illustrated in life. We also describe nine new sponge
  records for this region, some of which are new records for Brazil, or new
  records of species previously only poorly known. We present alpha and beta
  diversity indices and compare the sponge assemblage of the sampled locations.
  Four reefs were considered: two fringing reefs (Arraial D’Ajuda—AA and Coroa
  Vermelha / Mutá—CVM) and two offshore Municipal Marine Park “Parque Municipal
  Marinho— (P.M.M. Coroa Alta—CA and P.M.M. Recife de Fora—RF). A total of 229
  specimens were collected (224 Demospongiae, 2 Homoscleromorpha and 3
  Calcarea). These were classified in 101 morphotypes. Studied materials
  included representatives of 15 orders, 34 families and 48 genera. The richest
  orders are Haplosclerida (29 spp.), Poecilosclerida (15 spp.) and
  Tetractinellida (11 spp.). The richest families were Chalinidae (24 spp.),
  Clionaidae (7 spp.) and Mycalidae and Suberitidae (6 spp. each). The richest
  genus is, by far, Haliclona (20 spp.). Only 13 species were shared among all
  four reefs surveyed, namely Amphimedon viridis, Cinachyrella alloclada, C.
  apion, Cladocroce caelum, Cliona varians, Dysidea robusta, Mycale (Naviculina)
  diversisigmata, Niphates erecta, Spirastrella hartmani, Tedania (Tedania)
  ignis, Terpios fugax, Tethya bitylastra and T. maza. The reefs with the
  highest richness were CA and CVM, and the lowest richness was observed in RF.
  The most similar reefs in terms of species composition were CA and CVM, while
  AA and RF were more dissimilar to the previous reefs, but also from each
  other. While the difference among CA, CVM and AA was mainly explained by
  species turnover, RF differed from the previous based on its lower richness
  (nestedness component). Even though CA and CVM were the richest reefs, AA
  presented the highest number of exclusive species, highlighting the uniqueness
  of this reef, and urging the inclusion of local beachrock fringing reefs in a
  more holistic conservation strategy at Costa do Descobrimento.
